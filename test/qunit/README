QUnit-CLI

Example extensions for running QUnit tests from the command line

Examples and extensions assume use of a standalone JavaScript interpeter such as Mozilla Rhino.  QUnit.js is now downloaded as a submodule (tracking my fork).

To download and run the sample test suite using Mozilla Rhino ...

1) git clone git://github.com/benjaminplee/QUnit-CLI.git qunit-cli --recursive
2) setup rhino as described here: http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/make-javascript-tests-part-of-your-build-qunit-rhino/
3) run "js rhino/suite.js"
4) Profit!

An example of running QUnit using the Java 6 embedded JavaScript engine can be seen in rhino/Java6RhinoRunner.java (more info at: http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/java-6-scripting-is-no-js-jar/)

An example of running QUnit from a browser can be seen by opening up web/index.html in your favorite web browser.
