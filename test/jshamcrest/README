JsHamcrest
----------

JsHamcrest is a JavaScript library heavily inspired by Hamcrest. It provides
a large library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates)
allowing “match” rules to be defined declaratively. Typical scenarios include
testing frameworks, mocking libraries, UI validation rules and object querying.

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of the BSD License
and sponsored by Destaquenet Technology Solutions, a brazilian software
development and consultancy startup.
