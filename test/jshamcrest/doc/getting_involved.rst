Getting Involved
================

As with any open source project, there are several ways you can help:

* Report bugs, feature requests and other issues in the
  `issue tracking system <http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/issues>`_;
* Submit patches to reported issues (both those you find, or that others have
  filed);
* Help with the documentation by pointing out areas that are lacking or unclear,
  and if you are so inclined, submitting patches to correct it;
* Improve the overall project quality by suggesting refactorings and improving
  the test cases. A great way to learn -- and in turn give value back to the
  community -- is to review someone else's code. So, we invite you to review
  ours;
* Write about JsHamcrest in your blog or personal web site. Let your friends
  know about this project.

Your participation is much appreciated. Keep up with JsHamcrest development on
`GitHub <http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/tree/master>`_.


How Do I Join The Team?
-----------------------

JsHamcrest is a mature project and it's probably not going to get lots of new
features. But those that the developers notice participating to a high extent
will be invited to join the team as a committer.

This is as much based on personality and ability to work with other developers
and the community as it is with proven technical ability. Being unhelpful to
other users, or obviously looking to become a committer for bragging rights and
nothing else is frowned upon, as is asking to be made a committer without having
contributed sufficiently to be invited.
