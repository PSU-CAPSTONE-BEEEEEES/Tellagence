\section{Overview}
	\subsection{Objective}
	The objective of this project is essentially to model and visualize the strengths of relationships on Twitter. This will be a web based application that renders a visual representation of the relationships between users on Twitter and the strengths of those relationships to show who are the most influential users in different networks of users.
  \subsection{Requirements}
	In talks with Matt and Nitin from Tellagence, we gathered and understood the following requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The relationships themselves are defined by interactions between users via '@' mentions and retweets.
		\item The mention and retweet values will be parsed from Twitter data into a database in a format for the rendering.
		\item The rendering needs to be usable and coherent, not just a tangled mess of nodes and connections.
		\item Directions of the relationships in the Twitter data don't matter, just the connections.
		\item Strengths of the relationships are determined by frequency of mentions/retweets between users over 7 days.
		\item We need to be able to parse multiple '@' mentions out of a single tweet.
		\item The purpose of the visual is about predicting behavior and showing which users are the most influential, meaning the most meaningful connections.
		\item The core requirements of modeling relationships and strengths while maintaining coherency are the most important. Features such as searching are second priority.
	\end{itemize}

  \subsection{Approach}
	To complete this project, three main sections of the project have been identified: Data Handling, Rendering, and Interface. These three sections are planned to be completed in parallel, with milestones and tasks broken down in each. The plan is to speed up development by coding in parallel and doing a minimal implementations of the requirements first, then building on those implementations incrementally for a better finished product.
	\\\\
	The scheduled tasks and milestones should be contained to an eight week time frame. This allows for two weeks of spare time at the end of the term prior to the final deadline, which helps save us if and when issues arise concerning the project that merit more time than originally budgeted. With the milestones lining up as well, there should be a very basic iteration of the project by around the fourth week in the time line.

\section{Role Descriptions}
  \subsection{Aren Edlund-Jermain}
  {\bf Testing and Validation:} Must ensure that software passes tests and meets requirements. Check each stage of process to ensure proper software behavior with unit tests. Stay aware of client specifications and ensure that software project meets those goals. Maintain automatic build system. Write appropriate unit tests for each individual piece of project.
  \subsection{Derek Hurley}
  {\bf Team Lead and Sponsor Contact:} Team Lead must plan meetings, aid in overall design and implementation of the project, mediate conflicts between team members, and generally make sure work is completed in an efficient manner. Sponsor Contact must maintain frequent communication with the team sponsors to keep them aware of the project status and gather requirements/clarifications as needed.
  \subsection{Huy Tran}
  {\bf Documentation Lead:} Documentation Lead must ensure the following. First, having a agreed template for a document which is suitable for each team member to add their contents into it. Second, there are sufficient, up to date documents for all parts of the project. At the end of each development phase, Documentation Lead must ensure that all documents for all parts are integrated into one comprehensive document.
  \subsection{Jonathan Harker}
  {\bf Issues and Ticketing Lead:} Ensure that deadlines are met, bugs are resolved in a timely manner, and the project moves forward as planned.
  \subsection{Long Nguyen}
  {\bf Architectural Design and Tech Lead:} Prospect the scope of the entire project and construct architecture. Coordinate with all programmers to keep improving architectural design. Do major research on GUI tech and demo for other members.
  \subsection{Tien Le}
  {\bf System Administrator Lead:} Keep all of the computers running 24/7, software and package installation, backup cron job, testing code and html5 research.

\section{Risk Management}
There are four main issues in risk management which we classified. 
\begin{itemize}
     \item First, sponsor issues include several problems. For communicating, we can make phone calls, or talk to course instructor. Besides, if the data or requirements provided by the sponsor are ill defined, we can use fake numbers for processed data. In the worst case, if the sponsors disappears, then we would go to their office and talk to the course instructor.
    \item Second, back ups for our Redmine repo can be handled by setting up Github which clones every changes in Redmine, also by using local copies. If our local copies get corrupted, the Redmine and Github repos should be intact.
    \item Third, there are a few main problems in team member issues. If a team member does not communicate or be present, then you would talk with other team members. Also, if a team member could not complete a task, we can break it up among other members. With the team members that keep tabs on other portions of the project, the risk of getting out of sync milestones arises, which is mainly solved through putting more people on the tasks to get the respective portion back up to speed.
	\item Finally, development issues include lack of experience of team members in designing and coding. It can be handled by doing the easier tasks first, which are 2D rendering, zoomed in features, then move to harder stuff later (3D rendering, zoomed out feature). Also,we need to make sure architecture will be nailed down.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quality Assurance}
    Testing and quality assurance is a process that cannot be planned completely on the front end. The testing for this project will be planned and executed throughout the process. Test driven development is encouraged and the mocking framework planned will help to implement those unit tests.
	\\\\
	Buildbot, a continuous integration system, will be used to ensure tests are run after each commit and status of those tests are communicated to the appropriate developers. Below is a listing of testing utilities and approaches that will be used in this project's development.
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf JSMockito}: This tool is a stand-alone javascript mocking
    environment. 
    \item {\bf JSUnit}: This tool is designed to help create unit tests for
    javascript. This package has some built in mocking tools but they are not
    very reliable.
    \item {\bf HTML5}: Test using different browsers? Have to do more research
    in effective HTML5 testing frameworks.
\end{itemize}
	\\\\
	For validation, at every milestone we will talk with the sponsor to make sure we're on track and they like it. The key is making sure it meets specifications and requirements set forth by the sponsors. After initial acceptance by the team and passing unit tests, we would then go to the sponsor for approval. This would happen each iteration of the milestones and product.
	\\\\
	To help assure the integration of the three components, each of the two team members on a specific component would keep tabs on a different component to make sure development was happening in a way to ensure proper interaction. For instance, Aren would watch the Data work and Derek would watch the Rendering work. That way, once the development calls for information to be passed between the components, the architecture would have taken that into account. Here is a diagram to illustrate this convention:\\\\
