			<strong>At this time, there are 8 test files:</strong>
		<br/>	
		<br/>test1: 3 nodes
		<br/>test2: 5 nodes
		<br/>test3: 10 nodes
		<br/>test4: 20 nodes
		<br/>test5: 30 nodes
		<br/>test6: 40 nodes
		<br/>test7: 50 nodes
		<br/>test8: 100 nodes
		<br>
		<br> <strong>Usage: </strong>
		<br/>
		<br> All shortest paths: if selected, all of links between nodes are shortest paths, if not they are normal paths.
		<br/>
		<br> Full view : if selected, show the graph in full view, if not, then showing graph side by side for comparing.
		<br/>
		<br> link's width : is infered from the normal distance, so the wider the link is , the stronger the relationship is.
		<br/>
		<br/>mouse over the link : show 2 numbers, 1st is the normal path, second is the shortest path
